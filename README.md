# PROYECTO 1 PYTHON
It took me a bit to set up Git because it doesn't explain everything clearly. Also, I found out that on Windows (my case), it's better to use the Git Bash terminal instead of CMD. Regarding the project, I struggled a bit with the decimal point issue. Initially, I wanted to use centimeters for measurements, but I preferred using a decimal point to indicate height. I had to research a bit more to figure that out. Capturing the other data was very easy.
